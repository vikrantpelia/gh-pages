    The Fly UX mobile app was designed as a project during my ‘Professional Diploma in UX Design’ course with the UX Design Institute.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project (my first in UX design) was tailored to guide me through the process of researching, designing, and prototyping a mobile app for a fictional start-up airline.
  </p>

    <h2 id="step-1-research">
      Step 1: Research
    </h2>

  <p>
    I had two key research goals: 1) learn from competitors’ booking experiences (competitive benchmarking) and 2) understand users’ perspectives (user research).
  </p>

    <h3 id="competitive-benchmarking">
      Competitive Benchmarking
    </h3>

  <p>
    I chose to study the easyJet, British Airways, Qatar Airways, and Skyscanner apps for a variety of references. I did that by putting myself in the shoes of a user and flowing through their booking experiences. That allowed me to identify the positive and negative elements of their experiences, which I could use as inspiration when it came to designing the Fly UX app.

      User Research
    </h3>

  <p>
    The UX Design Institute provided two usability test examples within the course material. I watched through those and made note of the comments the users made while flowing through the Aer Lingus and Eurowings booking experiences. In addition, I conducted an online survey and usability test of my own for further insights. The combined insights gave me an understanding of users’ goals, behaviours, and pain points – which was invaluable information that would guide my design decisions later on.
