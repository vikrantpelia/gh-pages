  <p>
    I visited my grandmother recently and mentioned that I was leaving my job to focus on pursuing a career in product design. I expected her to contest me leaving my comfortable, corporate job… but she didn’t. Instead, she asked me to explain what product design is. She heard me out and said… “you’ve always been interested in that — even as a child”.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, either my grandmother knows more about product design than I thought she did, or I just explained it very well. Either way, her response was spot on!<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve been infatuated with the way things look and work since as far back as I can remember. I recall pulling things apart just to inspect why they looked and worked the way they did. I’d observe the way objects felt, the way they were shaped, their colours. I remember seeing an iMac G3 for the first time and thought it came from outer space!<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    Granted, I wasn’t thinking too much into the details as a kid, but there was something about them that fascinated me. Looking back, those moments were foundations being laid for a future career in design.
  </p>

  <p>
    But then I grew up to study ‘Business’ at University, and pursue a career in marketing. I don’t know why, but that’s where destiny took me. Perhaps it’s because I was also quite entrepreneurial growing up. I knew I wanted to be in the world of business — and marketing seemed to be the most suitable home for my creative skills and right-brained nature.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don’t regret my path, because I’ve learned a lot through working in marketing (especially graphic design) and got to work with amazing people on interesting projects. But in 2022, my interest in marketing started to fade. Marketing didn’t seem ‘for me’ anymore. I had switched from Brand Marketing to Product Marketing, and being closer to Product lit a flame in me… I wanted to get even closer. I started remembering those moments as a kid and felt an urge to follow my calling to become a Product Designer.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    So, in September 2022, I decided to invest in myself by enrolling into UX and UI design courses. I ultimately want to be an Industrial Designer, but entering the software space felt like the most natural first step, because of my transferrable graphic design skills. I loved the courses, but there was an issue — with a demanding full-time job, I wasn’t able to give them all the attention they needed. I thought long and hard about what I should do, and felt a desire to resign from my job. In October, I decided to go all-in on product design and handed in my notice.
  </p>

  <p>
    Long story short, I ended up staying on for three months in a part-time capacity. My boss kindly proposed it to me as it would give me the balance I needed to be able to study, as well as buy me some time to decide whether resigning is truly what I want. Three months later, it’s still what I want, and I’m writing this post as an unemployed student of product design.
  </p>

  <p>
    As one of my idols (Steve Jobs) once said… “You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards”. I feel like I’m finally following my calling. I’m doing what I was always supposed to do and I’ve never been more excited. I can’t wait to help make things that create a positive impact in the world. And maybe, just maybe, a kid somewhere will be fascinated enough to pull them apart and spark their own obsession with design.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was always destined to be a designer, I just didn’t always know. But now I do.<br>

  <p>
    The Bank UI responsive app was designed as a project during my ‘Professional Certificate in UI Design’ course with the UX Design Institute.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project (my first in UI design) comprised of a series of short exercises tailored to guide me through the process designing a responsive app that works across mobile, tablet, and mobile.
  </p>

    <h4 id="step-1-create-moodboards">
      Step 1: Create Moodboards
    </h4>

  <p>
    My first task was to create several moodboards full of inspiration to help me with my designs later in the process. The idea was to find examples of apps that visually conveyed Bank UI’s brand principles – playful, clear, and trustworthy. The insights gained from the moodboarding helped me to make decisions on which fonts, colours, and other UI elements I wanted to incorporate in my designs.
  </p>

    </figure>

    <h2 id="step-2-create-a-grid-system">
      Step 2: Create a Grid System
    </h2>

  <p>
    My next task was to create a grid system using a 8pt grid and 12 column grid. The column grid was adjusted to 8 columns for the tablet screens and 4 columns for the mobile screens. The purpose of the grid system is to ensure each screen has a structured layout with consistent proportions, spacing, and margins – resulting in pixel-perfect designs that are easier for users to read and scan.
  </p>

    </figure>

    <h2 id="step-3-choose-fonts">
      Step 3: Choose Fonts
    </h2>

  <p>
    To comply with the brand principles, I did some research to identify the most playful and friendly fonts – and Lexend + Zilla Slab were among those highly recommended. It was also favourable that both fonts were open source and included multiple weights for flexibility. Initially, I paired both and intended to use Lexend has a headings font, and Zilla Slab as a body font, but as I continued to iterate my screen designs I settled on Lexend as the only font.
  </p>

    <figure class="post__image post__image--center">
      <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/Bank-UI-Fonts.png" height="2160" width="3840" alt=""  sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw" srcset="https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Fonts-xs.png 384w ,https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Fonts-sm.png 600w ,https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Fonts-md.png 768w ,https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Fonts-lg.png 1200w ,https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Fonts-xl.png 1600w">
      
    </figure>

    <h2 id="step-4-create-a-colour-palette">
      Step 4: Create a Colour Palette
    </h2>

  <p>
    As with the fonts, I searched for playful and friendly colour inspiration. I looked at competitor apps but also explored palettes with blue and green shades in them – as the colour blue is associated with banking and the colour green is associated with money. I consequently created a palette of my own, made up of blue and green shades as accent colours, but also modified my selection slightly as I went through iterations.
  </p>

    <figure class="post__image post__image--center">
      <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette.png" height="2160" width="3840" alt=""  sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw" srcset="https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette-xs.png 384w ,https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette-sm.png 600w ,https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette-md.png 768w ,https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette-lg.png 1200w ,https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette-xl.png 1600w">
      
    </figure>

    <h2 id="step-5-generate-icons">
      Step 5: Generate Icons
    </h2>

  <p>
    For icon inspiration, I looked at some competitive apps but also searched for banking/finance specific icon sets. As a minimalist, I favoured icons that were simple and stumbled across a set of open source icons that were perfect for my use case – so I stuck with those instead of creating a fresh new set of icons.
  </p>

    <figure class="post__image post__image--center">
      <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/Bank-UI-Icons.png" height="2160" width="3840" alt=""  sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw" srcset="https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Icons-xs.png 384w ,https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Icons-sm.png 600w ,https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Icons-md.png 768w ,https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Icons-lg.png 1200w ,https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Icons-xl.png 1600w">
      
    </figure>

    <h2 id="step-6-design-screens">
      Step 6: Design Screens
    </h2>

  <p>
    I went through a few iterations and played with the different colours and Lexend + Zilla Slab font combination. As mentioned above, I altered my colour choices and stuck with one font only for the final designs. True to <a href="https://vikrantpelia.com/fly-ux-2.html" target="_blank">my UX learnings</a>, I also kept the experience at the forefront of my mind for each design iteration. I tried to balance the required aesthetic creativity with a sense of simplicity, and the result was a minimal and intuitive set of screens aligned with the Bank UI brand values.

      Reflection
    </h2>

  <p>
    Although this app was not actually built and launched, the project gave me thorough, practical exposure to the importance of UI in software design
  </p>

  <p>
    I wasn’t completely new to the concept of designing screens prior to this project, due to my experience with graphic design and using Figma, but I learned that alone isn’t enough when it comes to good UI design. I walk away with a deeper understanding of UI elements and the thinking that needs to go into selecting them for a design.
  </p>

  <p>
    And most importantly, this experience layers on top of my exposure to UX design, giving me a holistic view of what it takes to design great software.

  <p>
    The Bank UI responsive app was designed as a project during my ‘Professional Certificate in UI Design’ course with the UX Design Institute.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project (my first in UI design) comprised of a series of short exercises tailored to guide me through the process designing a responsive app that works across mobile, tablet, and mobile.
  </p>

    <h2 id="step-1-create-moodboards">
      Step 1: Create Moodboards
    </h2>

  <p>
    My first task was to create several moodboards full of inspiration to help me with my designs later in the process. The idea was to find examples of apps that visually conveyed Bank UI’s brand principles – playful, clear, and trustworthy. The insights gained from the moodboarding helped me to make decisions on which fonts, colours, and other UI elements I wanted to incorporate in my designs.

    </figure>

    <h2 id="step-2-create-a-grid-system">
      Step 2: Create a Grid System
    </h2>

  <p>
    My next task was to create a grid system using a 8pt grid and 12 column grid. The column grid was adjusted to 8 columns for the tablet screens and 4 columns for the mobile screens. The purpose of the grid system is to ensure each screen has a structured layout with consistent proportions, spacing, and margins – resulting in pixel-perfect designs that are easier for users to read and scan.

    <h2 id="step-3-choose-fonts">
      Step 3: Choose Fonts
    </h2>

  <p>
    To comply with the brand principles, I did some research to identify the most playful and friendly fonts – and Lexend + Zilla Slab were among those highly recommended. It was also favourable that both fonts were open source and included multiple weights for flexibility. Initially, I paired both and intended to use Lexend has a headings font, and Zilla Slab as a body font, but as I continued to iterate my screen designs I settled on Lexend as the only font.

    </figure>

    <h2 id="step-4-create-a-colour-palette">
      Step 4: Create a Colour Palette
    </h2>

  <p>
    As with the fonts, I searched for playful and friendly colour inspiration. I looked at competitor apps but also explored palettes with blue and green shades in them – as the colour blue is associated with banking and the colour green is associated with money. I consequently created a palette of my own, made up of blue and green shades as accent colours, but also modified my selection slightly as I went through iterations.
  </p>

    </figure>

    <h2 id="step-5-generate-icons">
      Step 5: Generate Icons
    </h2>

  <p>
    For icon inspiration, I looked at some competitive apps but also searched for banking/finance specific icon sets. As a minimalist, I favoured icons that were simple and stumbled across a set of open source icons that were perfect for my use case – so I stuck with those instead of creating a fresh new set of icons.
  </p>

    </figure>

    <h2 id="step-6-design-screens">
      Step 6: Design Screens
    </h2>

  <p>
    I went through a few iterations and played with the different colours and Lexend + Zilla Slab font combination. As mentioned above, I altered my colour choices and stuck with one font only for the final designs. True to <a href="https://vikrantpelia.com/fly-ux-2.html" target="_blank">my UX learnings</a>, I also kept the experience at the forefront of my mind for each design iteration. I tried to balance the required aesthetic creativity with a sense of simplicity, and the result was a minimal and intuitive set of screens aligned with the Bank UI brand values.

    <h2 id="reflection">
      Reflection
    </h2>

  <p>
    Although this app was not actually built and launched, the project gave me thorough, practical exposure to the importance of UI in software design
  </p>

  <p>
    I wasn’t completely new to the concept of designing screens prior to this project, due to my experience with graphic design and using Figma, but I learned that alone isn’t enough when it comes to good UI design. I walk away with a deeper understanding of UI elements and the thinking that needs to go into selecting them for a design.
  </p>

  <p>
    And most importantly, this experience layers on top of my exposure to UX design, giving me a holistic view of what it takes to design great software.

  <p>
    The Fly UX mobile app was designed as a project during my ‘Professional Diploma in UX Design’ course with the UX Design Institute.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project (my first in UX design) was tailored to guide me through the process of researching, designing, and prototyping a mobile app for a fictional start-up airline.
  </p>

    <h2 id="step-1-research">
      Step 1: Research
    </h2>

  <p>
    I had two key research goals:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Learn from competitors’ booking experiences (competitive benchmarking).</li><li>Understand users’ perspectives (user research).</li>
  </ol>

    <h3 id="competitive-benchmarking">
      Competitive Benchmarking
    </h3>

  <p>
    I chose to study the easyJet, British Airways, Qatar Airways, and Skyscanner apps for a variety of references. I did that by putting myself in the shoes of a user and flowing through their booking experiences. That allowed me to identify the positive and negative elements of their experiences, which I could use as inspiration when it came to designing the Fly UX app.
  </p>

    <h3 id="user-research">
      User Research
    </h3>

  <p>
    The UX Design Institute provided two usability test examples within the course material. I watched through those and made note of the comments the users made while flowing through the Aer Lingus and Eurowings booking experiences. In addition, I conducted an online survey and usability test of my own for further insights. The combined insights gave me an understanding of users’ goals, behaviours, and pain points – which was invaluable information that would guide my design decisions later on.
  </p>

    <h2 id="step-2-design">
      Step 2: Design
    </h2>

  <p>
    The first step of the design phase was to make sense of all the research insights by creating an affinity diagram. Those insights were going to guide my design decisions, so it was important that they were structured and usable.

    <h3 id="customer-journey-map">
      Customer Journey Map
    </h3>

  <p>
    The next step was to create a customer journey map. The goal was to define the high-level steps a prospective user would take to book a flight using the Fly UX app. The steps in the process were informed by the goal, behaviour, and pain point patterns I identified from the user research.

  <p>
    Once I had the customer journey structured, I was ready to define the Fly UX booking process. The purpose behind this was to understand and craft how users will flow through the app, so I could then design around that flow.

      Screen Sketches

  <p>
    Now that I’d defined how the app should flow, it was finally time to start visualising it. Before jumping head-first into Figma, I created a list of screens and states based on the flow and sketched each of them out. This was helpful as it enabled me to paint a picture of how the app could look and work, which saved a lot of thinking time when it came to actually designing it.

    The final step of the process was to take the sketches and turn them into a clickable prototype in Figma. As the brief asked for medium-fidelity, I kept the aesthetics minimal, but added a good amount of layout, text, and interaction detail.
  </p>

  <p>
    The result was different to what I had initially sketched, because my designs evolved as I continued to iterate, but the screens remained aligned with the user flow. An example of something I didn’t sketch was the search bar on the home screen. As I iterated, I thought why not give the user the ability to search for where they’d like to go as soon as the app opens?

    I also asked family and friends to test the prototype and conducted a usability test. Fortunately, the testing went very well and the prototype was perceived to be fast, easy, and intuitive (success!). There were suggestions around adding more detail, but the users understood that those were applicable to a high-fidelity prototype.

    This app was not actually built and launched, so I can’t speak to the impact it had on users and a business. But I can speak to the impact it had on me.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>This was my first product design project.</li><li>It exposed me to level of design thinking and attention to detail required in order to design software.</li><li>It helped me to develop a great understanding of the UX design process.</li><li>I enjoyed learning key research, design, and prototyping skills – including usability testing, mapping user flows, and building prototypes.</li><li>I developed my first case study to kickstart my product design portfolio.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    And most importantly, working on this project made me feel even more convinced that product design is the right field for me!

  <p>
    I visited my grandmother recently and mentioned that I was leaving my job to focus on pursuing a career in product design. I expected her to contest me leaving my comfortable, corporate job… but she didn’t. Instead, she asked me to explain what product design is. She heard me out and said… “you’ve always been interested in that — even as a child”.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, either my grandmother knows more about product design than I thought she did, or I just explained it very well. Either way, her response was spot on!<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve been infatuated with the way things look and work since as far back as I can remember. I recall pulling things apart just to inspect why they looked and worked the way they did. I’d observe the way objects felt, the way they were shaped, their colours. I remember seeing an iMac G3 for the first time and thought it came from outer space!<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    Granted, I wasn’t thinking too much into the details as a kid, but there was something about them that fascinated me. Looking back, those moments were foundations being laid for a future career in design.
  </p>

  <p>
    But then I grew up to study ‘Business’ at University, and pursue a career in marketing. I don’t know why, but that’s where destiny took me. Perhaps it’s because I was also quite entrepreneurial growing up. I knew I wanted to be in the world of business — and marketing seemed to be the most suitable home for my creative skills and right-brained nature.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don’t regret my path, because I’ve learned a lot through working in marketing (especially graphic design) and got to work with amazing people on interesting projects. But in 2022, my interest in marketing started to fade. Marketing didn’t seem ‘for me’ anymore. I had switched from Brand Marketing to Product Marketing, and being closer to Product lit a flame in me… I wanted to get even closer. I started remembering those moments as a kid and felt an urge to follow my calling to become a Product Designer.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    So, in September 2022, I decided to invest in myself by enrolling into UX and UI design courses. I ultimately want to be an Industrial Designer, but entering the software space felt like the most natural first step, because of my transferrable graphic design skills. I loved the courses, but there was an issue — with a demanding full-time job, I wasn’t able to give them all the attention they needed. I thought long and hard about what I should do, and felt a desire to resign from my job. In October, I decided to go all-in on product design and handed in my notice.
  </p>

  <p>
    Long story short, I ended up staying on for three months in a part-time capacity. My boss kindly proposed it to me as it would give me the balance I needed to be able to study, as well as buy me some time to decide whether resigning is truly what I want. Three months later, it’s still what I want, and I’m writing this post as an unemployed student of product design.
  </p>

  <p>
    As one of my idols (Steve Jobs) once said… “You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards”. I feel like I’m finally following my calling. I’m doing what I was always supposed to do and I’ve never been more excited. I can’t wait to help make things that create a positive impact in the world. And maybe, just maybe, a kid somewhere will be fascinated enough to pull them apart and spark their own obsession with design.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was always destined to be a designer, I just didn’t always know. But now I do.<br>
