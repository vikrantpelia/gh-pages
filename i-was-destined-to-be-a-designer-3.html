I expected her to contest me leaving my comfortable, corporate job… but she didn’t. Instead, she asked me to explain what product design is. She heard me out and said… “you’ve always been interested in that — even as a child”.</p><p>Now, either my grandmother knows more about product design than I thought she did, or I just explained it very well. Either way, her response was spot on!<br></p><p>I’ve been infatuated with the way things look and work since as far back as I can remember. I recall pulling things apart just to inspect why they looked and worked the way they did. I’d observe the way objects felt, the way they were shaped, their colours. I remember seeing an iMac G3 for the first time and thought it came from outer space!<br></p><p>Granted, I wasn’t thinking too much into the details as a kid, but there was something about them that fascinated me. Looking back, those moments were foundations being laid for a future career in design.</p><p>But then I grew up to study ‘Business’ at University, and pursue a career in marketing. I don’t know why, but that’s where destiny took me. Perhaps it’s because I was also quite entrepreneurial growing up. I knew I wanted to be in the world of business — and marketing seemed to be the most suitable home for my creative skills and right-brained nature.</p><p>I don’t regret my path, because I’ve learned a lot through working in marketing (especially graphic design) and got to work with amazing people on interesting projects. But in 2022, my interest in marketing started to fade. Marketing didn’t seem ‘for me’ anymore. I had switched from Brand Marketing to Product Marketing, and being closer to Product lit a flame in me… I wanted to get even closer. I started remembering those moments as a kid and felt an urge to follow my calling to become a Product Designer.<br></p><p>So, in September 2022, I decided to invest in myself by enrolling into UX and UI design courses. I ultimately want to be an Industrial Designer, but entering the software space felt like the most natural first step, because of my transferrable graphic design skills. I loved the courses, but there was an issue — with a demanding full-time job, I wasn’t able to give them all the attention they needed. I thought long and hard about what I should do, and felt a desire to resign from my job. In October, I decided to go all-in on product design and handed in my notice.</p><p>Long story short, I ended up staying on for three months in a part-time capacity. My boss kindly proposed it to me as it would give me the balance I needed to be able to study, as well as buy me some time to decide whether resigning is truly what I want. Three months later, it’s still what I want, and I’m writing this post as an unemployed student of product design.</p><p>As one of my idols (Steve Jobs) once said… “You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards”. I feel like I’m finally following my calling. I’m doing what I was always supposed to do and I’ve never been more excited. I can’t wait to help make things that create a positive impact in the world. And maybe, just maybe, a kid somewhere will be fascinated enough to pull them apart and spark their own obsession with design.</p><p>I was always destined to be a designer, I just didn’t always know. But now I do.<br></p><p>Thank you for reading,<br></p><p>Vikrant</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__tag-share"></div></footer></div></article><div class="content__related"><h3 class="content__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><figure class="c-card__image"><img src="https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/9/GWR-Feature.png" srcset="https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/9/responsive/GWR-Feature-xs.png 384w, https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/9/responsive/GWR-Feature-sm.png 600w, https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/9/responsive/GWR-Feature-md.png 768w, https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/9/responsive/GWR-Feature-lg.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 80vw, 50vw" loading="lazy" height="1080" width="1920" alt=""></figure><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://vikrantpelia.com/i-was-destined-to-be-a-designer-2.html" class="invert">I was destined to be a designer (copy)</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><figure class="c-card__image"><img src="https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/8/GWR-Feature.png" srcset="https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/8/responsive/GWR-Feature-xs.png 384w, https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/8/responsive/GWR-Feature-sm.png 600w, https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/8/responsive/GWR-Feature-md.png 768w, https://vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/8/responsive/GWR-Feature-lg.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 80vw, 50vw" loading="lazy" height="1080" width="1920" alt=""></figure><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://vikrantpelia.com/i-was-destined-to-be-a-designer.html" class="invert">I was destined to be a designer</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy">Copyright © 2025 Vikrant Pelia</div></div><div class="footer__right"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.x.com" aria-label="Twitter" class="twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="https://vikrantpelia.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.instagran.com" aria-label="Instagram" class="instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="https://vikrantpelia.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com" aria-label="LinkedIn" class="linkedin"><svg><use xlink:href="https://vikrantpelia.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://vikrantpelia.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://vikrantpelia.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=9c5ab7a87221183f149a42b3cceb7956"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
