To avoid busy queues at the station, I tried to purchase my ticket in advance via the GWR app. However, when selecting my ‘ticket delivery’ method, I was presented with three options:\n  </p>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li>Load to smartcard now</li><li>Load to smartcard at station</li><li>Collect ticket at station</li>\n  </ol>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/GWR-Ticket-Delivery.png\" height=\"1080\" width=\"1920\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Ticket-Delivery-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Ticket-Delivery-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Ticket-Delivery-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Ticket-Delivery-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Ticket-Delivery-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    As I didn’t own a Smartcard at the time, my only option was to collect my ticket at the station. That limitation defeated the purpose of using the app to avoid queuing at the station. So, I put my designer’s hat on and decided to investigate.<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"the-process\">\n      The Process\n    </h2>\n\n    <h3 id=\"step-1-research\">\n      Step 1: Research\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    I took some time to play around with the app, inputting different travel scenarios to test if the ticket delivery options changed. I discovered that there are four ticket delivery options in total, but each has its limitations.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/GWR-Ticket-Delivery-All.png\" height=\"1080\" width=\"1920\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Ticket-Delivery-All-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Ticket-Delivery-All-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Ticket-Delivery-All-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Ticket-Delivery-All-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Ticket-Delivery-All-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h4 id=\"1-download-a-mobile-ticket\">\n      1. Download a mobile ticket\n    </h4>\n\n  <p>\n    This is what I was looking for! However, research uncovered that this option is only available for some journeys/stations. Mobile tickets require special barcode scanners, which TfL stations don't currently have. That explains why I was not presented with the mobile ticket option when I was trying to purchase my ticket. Otherwise, this would be ideal!\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/GWR-Mobile-Ticket.png\" height=\"1080\" width=\"1920\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Mobile-Ticket-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Mobile-Ticket-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Mobile-Ticket-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Mobile-Ticket-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Mobile-Ticket-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h4 id=\"2-load-to-smartcard-now\">\n      2. Load to Smartcard now\n    </h4>\n\n  <p>\n    This option allows commuters to load tickets to their Smartcards, and is available for all journeys. Great idea, however, you have to scan your Smartcard with your smartphone to load a ticket. That's like having to scan your debit card when trying to make a payment or transfer through your banking app. Why the extra step?\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/GWR-Load-Smartcard.png\" height=\"1080\" width=\"1920\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Load-Smartcard-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Load-Smartcard-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Load-Smartcard-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Load-Smartcard-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Load-Smartcard-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h4 id=\"3-load-to-smartcard-at-station\">\n      3. Load to Smartcard at station\n    </h4>\n\n  <p>\n    This option didn’t make sense to me. If I had a Smartcard, why would I purchase my ticket through the app and then queue to load it at the station? And even if I wanted to do that, I would have to wait 2 hours before I’m able to load my Smartcard. Bizarre! Perhaps there’s some data behind these decisions, but I found it to be the most nonsensical option.<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/GWR-Load-Ticket-at-Station.png\" height=\"1080\" width=\"1920\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Load-Ticket-at-Station-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Load-Ticket-at-Station-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Load-Ticket-at-Station-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Load-Ticket-at-Station-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Load-Ticket-at-Station-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h4 id=\"4-collect-ticket-at-station\">\n      4. Collect ticket at station\n    </h4>\n\n  <p>\n    This was my only viable option – and it would be the same for any other commuter without a Smartcard. Also, it comes with a caveat… you can only collect a ticket if you are purchasing it at least one hour before travelling. I was well within that time frame, but if I wasn’t, I wouldn’t have been able to purchase my ticket through the app. Bizarre, again!\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/GWR-Collect-Ticket-at-Station.png\" height=\"1080\" width=\"1920\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Collect-Ticket-at-Station-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Collect-Ticket-at-Station-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Collect-Ticket-at-Station-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Collect-Ticket-at-Station-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Collect-Ticket-at-Station-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    The conclusion of my investigation was that the GWR app experience could be improved. I wanted to come up with a more convenient and intuitive way for commuters to purchase and access tickets.<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"step-2-ideationlessbrgreater\">\n      Step 2: Ideation<br>\n    </h3>\n\n    <h4 id=\"idea-1-mobile-ticket-expansionlessbrgreater\">\n      Idea 1: Mobile Ticket Expansion<br>\n    </h4>\n\n  <p>\n    The first idea that naturally came to mind was making the mobile ticket delivery option available for TfL journeys. However, it would require substantial investment to install the barcode scanners at TfL stations, meaning it wouldn’t be a feasible idea today. Perhaps an idea for the future!\n  </p>\n\n    <h4 id=\"idea-2-digital-smartcardlessbrgreater\">\n      Idea 2: Digital Smartcard<br>\n    </h4>\n\n  <p>\n    Then, I thought of a simpler solution. Why not have a digital version of the Smartcard that commuters can add to their smartphone wallets? Much like the mobile tickets, commuters can tap and go using their smartphones and negate having to carry around a paper ticket or physical card. And, you wouldn’t need to scan a physical Smartcard to load a ticket onto it!<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Unlike mobile tickets, the Smartcard would not have any compatibility issues due to it utilising NFC/contactless technology – which is already present at all stations. GWR would just need to make software updates to enable the integration of mobile credentials, allowing commuters to add their cards to their mobile wallets. This idea still requires effort, but a lot less than installing barcode scanners at TfL stations... and consequently a lot less costly!<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"step-3-design\">\n      Step 3: Design\n    </h3>\n\n    <h4 id=\"1-user-flow\">\n      1. User Flow\n    </h4>\n\n  <p>\n    I mapped a user flow to better understand how the digital Smartcard would work, using my own use case (taking a return journey from Slough to London) as an example.<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    First, I made a high-level list of the steps in the flow:\n  </p>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li>Set departure station (Slough)</li><li>Set arrival station (Paddington)</li><li>Set to return journey</li><li>Select outward option</li><li>Select ticket option</li><li>Review order</li><li>Sign in to purchase</li><li>Pay using Apple Pay</li><li>Add Smartcard to wallet<br></li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <p>\n    Then, I expanded these steps into a more detailed user flow using FigJam. This also helped me to identify all the screens and states I would need to design to build a prototype.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/GWR-Flow.png\" height=\"1080\" width=\"1920\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Flow-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Flow-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Flow-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Flow-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Flow-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h4 id=\"2-screen-sketches\">\n      2. Screen Sketches\n    </h4>\n\n  <p>\n    Before jumping into Figma and designing my prototype, I made a list of all the screens and states in my user flow. I learned that there would be three new screens, and two existing screens would require small edits. So, I proceeded to roughly sketch these screens, making it easier for me to visualise how they would need to appear in my prototype.\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"1-user-settings-screen\">\n      1. User Settings Screen\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    I needed to add a ‘My Smartcard’ link to the settings menu. When tapped, it will take users to the screen where they can view their Smartcard and add it to their wallet. In my opinion, the most suitable location for this was between the existing ‘My tickets’ and ‘My Railcards’ links.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/GWR-User-Settings-Sketch.png\" height=\"1080\" width=\"1920\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-User-Settings-Sketch-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-User-Settings-Sketch-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-User-Settings-Sketch-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-User-Settings-Sketch-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-User-Settings-Sketch-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h5 id=\"2-my-smartcard-screen\">\n      2. My Smartcard Screen\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    Next, I sketched the new ‘My Smartcard’ screen. I drew inspiration from similar screens I’ve seen before and kept it simple – the Smartcard and a button. I also sketched the confirmation screen that appears when adding a card to the Apple wallet, and a view of the Smartcard in the wallet itself. These are standard iOS screens, so little creativity was required here.<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/GWR-Apple-Wallet-Sketch.png\" height=\"1080\" width=\"1920\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Apple-Wallet-Sketch-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Apple-Wallet-Sketch-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Apple-Wallet-Sketch-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Apple-Wallet-Sketch-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Apple-Wallet-Sketch-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h5 id=\"3-ticket-purchase-successful-screen\">\n      3. Ticket Purchase Successful Screen\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    Finally, I sketched a tweaked version of the confirmation screen that appears after a ticket has been purchased. As the ticket will be automatically loaded to a Smartcard, I added the small message that appears to notify the user once they have manually loaded a ticket.<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/GWR-Ticket-Purchase-Successful-Sketch.png\" height=\"1080\" width=\"1920\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Ticket-Purchase-Successful-Sketch-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Ticket-Purchase-Successful-Sketch-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Ticket-Purchase-Successful-Sketch-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Ticket-Purchase-Successful-Sketch-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/GWR-Ticket-Purchase-Successful-Sketch-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h4 id=\"3-prototype\">\n      3. Prototype\n    </h4>\n\n  <p>\n    Now I was ready to create a high-fidelity prototype in Figma. Most of this process involved replicating existing screens and animations from the GWR app. I dissected every little detail and redesigned everything from scratch, in order to make my prototype as realistic as possible.

The column grid was adjusted to 8 columns for the tablet screens and 4 columns for the mobile screens. The purpose of the grid system is to ensure each screen has a structured layout with consistent proportions, spacing, and margins – resulting in pixel-perfect designs that are easier for users to read and scan.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/Bank-UI-Grid-System.png\" height=\"1080\" width=\"1920\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Grid-System-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Grid-System-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Grid-System-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Grid-System-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Grid-System-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h2 id=\"step-3-choose-fonts\">\n      Step 3: Choose Fonts\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    To comply with the brand principles, I did some research to identify the most playful and friendly fonts – and Lexend + Zilla Slab were among those highly recommended. It was also favourable that both fonts were open source and included multiple weights for flexibility. Initially, I paired both and intended to use Lexend has a headings font, and Zilla Slab as a body font, but as I continued to iterate my screen designs I settled on Lexend as the only font.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/Bank-UI-Fonts.png\" height=\"2160\" width=\"3840\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Fonts-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Fonts-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Fonts-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Fonts-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Fonts-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h2 id=\"step-4-create-a-colour-palette\">\n      Step 4: Create a Colour Palette\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    As with the fonts, I searched for playful and friendly colour inspiration. I looked at competitor apps but also explored palettes with blue and green shades in them – as the colour blue is associated with banking and the colour green is associated with money. I consequently created a palette of my own, made up of blue and green shades as accent colours, but also modified my selection slightly as I went through iterations.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette.png\" height=\"2160\" width=\"3840\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h2 id=\"step-5-generate-icons\">\n      Step 5: Generate Icons\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    For icon inspiration, I looked at some competitive apps but also searched for banking/finance specific icon sets. As a minimalist, I favoured icons that were simple and stumbled across a set of open source icons that were perfect for my use case – so I stuck with those instead of creating a fresh new set of icons.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/Bank-UI-Icons.png\" height=\"2160\" width=\"3840\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Icons-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Icons-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Icons-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Icons-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Icons-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h2 id=\"step-6-design-screens\">\n      Step 6: Design Screens\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    I went through a few iterations and played with the different colours and Lexend + Zilla Slab font combination. As mentioned above, I altered my colour choices and stuck with one font only for the final designs. True to <a href=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/bank-ui/\" target=\"_blank\">my UX learnings</a>, I also kept the experience at the forefront of my mind for each design iteration. I tried to balance the required aesthetic creativity with a sense of simplicity, and the result was a minimal and intuitive set of screens aligned with the Bank UI brand values.\n  </p>\n\n  <div  class=\"gallery-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"gallery\" data-columns=\"1\">\n      <figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/gallery/Bank-UI-Wireframes.png\" data-size=\"3840x2160\">\n        <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/gallery/Bank-UI-Wireframes-thumbnail.png\" height=\"432\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>Wireframes</figcaption>\n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/gallery/Bank-UI-Draft-Screens.png\" data-size=\"3840x2160\">\n        <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/gallery/Bank-UI-Draft-Screens-thumbnail.png\" height=\"432\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>Draft Screens</figcaption>\n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/gallery/Bank-UI-Final-My-Accounts-Screens.png\" data-size=\"3840x2160\">\n        <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/gallery/Bank-UI-Final-My-Accounts-Screens-thumbnail.png\" height=\"432\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>'My Accounts' Screens</figcaption>\n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/gallery/Bank-UI-Final-Current-Account-Screens.png\" data-size=\"3840x2160\">\n        <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/gallery/Bank-UI-Final-Current-Account-Screens-thumbnail.png\" height=\"432\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>'Current Account' Screens</figcaption>\n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/gallery/Bank-UI-Final-My-Spending-Screens.png\" data-size=\"3840x2160\">\n        <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/gallery/Bank-UI-Final-My-Spending-Screens-thumbnail.png\" height=\"432\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>'My Spending' Screens</figcaption>\n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/gallery/Bank-UI-My-Accounts-Screens.png\" data-size=\"3840x2160\">\n        <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/gallery/Bank-UI-My-Accounts-Screens-thumbnail.png\" height=\"432\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>'My Accounts' Wireframe vs After</figcaption>\n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/gallery/Bank-UI-Current-Accounts-Screens.png\" data-size=\"3840x2160\">\n        <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/gallery/Bank-UI-Current-Accounts-Screens-thumbnail.png\" height=\"432\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>'Current Account' Wireframe vs FInal</figcaption>\n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/gallery/Bank-UI-My-Spending-Screens.png\" data-size=\"3840x2160\">\n        <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/gallery/Bank-UI-My-Spending-Screens-thumbnail.png\" height=\"432\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>'My Spending' Wireframe vs FInal</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n    <h2 id=\"reflection\">\n      Reflection\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Although this app was not actually built and launched, the project gave me thorough, practical exposure to the importance of UI in software design\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I wasn’t completely new to the concept of designing screens prior to this project, due to my experience with graphic design and using Figma, but I learned that alone isn’t enough when it comes to good UI design.

The goal was to define the high-level steps a prospective user would take to book a flight using the Fly UX app. The steps in the process were informed by the goal, behaviour, and pain point patterns I identified from the user research.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/Fly-UX-Journey-Map.png\" height=\"2160\" width=\"3840\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Journey-Map-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Journey-Map-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Journey-Map-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Journey-Map-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Journey-Map-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h3 id=\"flow-diagram\">\n      Flow Diagram\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    Once I had the customer journey structured, I was ready to define the Fly UX booking process. The purpose behind this was to understand and craft how users will flow through the app, so I could then design around that flow.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/Fly-UX-Flow-Diagram.png\" height=\"2160\" width=\"3840\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Flow-Diagram-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Flow-Diagram-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Flow-Diagram-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Flow-Diagram-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Flow-Diagram-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h3 id=\"screen-sketches\">\n      Screen Sketches\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    Now that I’d defined how the app should flow, it was finally time to start visualising it. Before jumping head-first into Figma, I created a list of screens and states based on the flow and sketched each of them out. This was helpful as it enabled me to paint a picture of how the app could look and work, which saved a lot of thinking time when it came to actually designing it.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/Fly-UX-Sketches.png\" height=\"2160\" width=\"3840\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Sketches-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Sketches-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Sketches-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Sketches-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Sketches-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h2 id=\"step-3-prototype\">\n      Step 3: Prototype\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The final step of the process was to take the sketches and turn them into a clickable prototype in Figma. As the brief asked for medium-fidelity, I kept the aesthetics minimal, but added a good amount of layout, text, and interaction detail.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The result was different to what I had initially sketched, because my designs evolved as I continued to iterate, but the screens remained aligned with the user flow. An example of something I didn’t sketch was the search bar on the home screen. As I iterated, I thought why not give the user the ability to search for where they’d like to go as soon as the app opens?\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/Fly-UX-Prototyping.png\" height=\"2160\" width=\"3840\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Prototyping-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Prototyping-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Prototyping-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Prototyping-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Prototyping-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h3 id=\"usability-test\">\n      Usability Test\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    I also asked family and friends to test the prototype and conducted a usability test.
