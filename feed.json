The idea was to find examples of apps that visually conveyed Bank UI’s brand principles – playful, clear, and trustworthy.

The column grid was adjusted to 8 columns for the tablet screens and 4 columns for the mobile screens. The purpose of the grid system is to ensure each screen has a structured layout with consistent proportions, spacing, and margins – resulting in pixel-perfect designs that are easier for users to read and scan.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/Bank-UI-Grid-System.png\" height=\"1080\" width=\"1920\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Grid-System-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Grid-System-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Grid-System-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Grid-System-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Grid-System-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h2 id=\"step-3-choose-fonts\">\n      Step 3: Choose Fonts\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    To comply with the brand principles, I did some research to identify the most playful and friendly fonts – and Lexend + Zilla Slab were among those highly recommended. It was also favourable that both fonts were open source and included multiple weights for flexibility. Initially, I paired both and intended to use Lexend has a headings font, and Zilla Slab as a body font, but as I continued to iterate my screen designs I settled on Lexend as the only font.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/Bank-UI-Fonts.png\" height=\"2160\" width=\"3840\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Fonts-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Fonts-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Fonts-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Fonts-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Fonts-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h2 id=\"step-4-create-a-colour-palette\">\n      Step 4: Create a Colour Palette\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    As with the fonts, I searched for playful and friendly colour inspiration. I looked at competitor apps but also explored palettes with blue and green shades in them – as the colour blue is associated with banking and the colour green is associated with money. I consequently created a palette of my own, made up of blue and green shades as accent colours, but also modified my selection slightly as I went through iterations.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette.png\" height=\"2160\" width=\"3840\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h2 id=\"step-5-generate-icons\">\n      Step 5: Generate Icons\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    For icon inspiration, I looked at some competitive apps but also searched for banking/finance specific icon sets. As a minimalist, I favoured icons that were simple and stumbled across a set of open source icons that were perfect for my use case – so I stuck with those instead of creating a fresh new set of icons.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/Bank-UI-Icons.png\" height=\"2160\" width=\"3840\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Icons-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Icons-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Icons-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Icons-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/responsive/Bank-UI-Icons-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h2 id=\"step-6-design-screens\">\n      Step 6: Design Screens\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    I went through a few iterations and played with the different colours and Lexend + Zilla Slab font combination. As mentioned above, I altered my colour choices and stuck with one font only for the final designs. True to <a href=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/fly-ux-2.html\" target=\"_blank\">my UX learnings</a>, I also kept the experience at the forefront of my mind for each design iteration. I tried to balance the required aesthetic creativity with a sense of simplicity, and the result was a minimal and intuitive set of screens aligned with the Bank UI brand values.\n  </p>\n\n  <div  class=\"gallery-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"gallery\" data-columns=\"1\">\n      <figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/gallery/Bank-UI-Wireframes.png\" data-size=\"3840x2160\">\n        <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/gallery/Bank-UI-Wireframes-thumbnail.png\" height=\"432\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>Wireframes</figcaption>\n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/gallery/Bank-UI-Draft-Screens.png\" data-size=\"3840x2160\">\n        <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/gallery/Bank-UI-Draft-Screens-thumbnail.png\" height=\"432\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>Draft Screens</figcaption>\n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/gallery/Bank-UI-Final-My-Accounts-Screens.png\" data-size=\"3840x2160\">\n        <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/gallery/Bank-UI-Final-My-Accounts-Screens-thumbnail.png\" height=\"432\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>'My Accounts' Screens</figcaption>\n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/gallery/Bank-UI-Final-Current-Account-Screens.png\" data-size=\"3840x2160\">\n        <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/gallery/Bank-UI-Final-Current-Account-Screens-thumbnail.png\" height=\"432\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>'Current Account' Screens</figcaption>\n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/gallery/Bank-UI-Final-My-Spending-Screens.png\" data-size=\"3840x2160\">\n        <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/gallery/Bank-UI-Final-My-Spending-Screens-thumbnail.png\" height=\"432\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>'My Spending' Screens</figcaption>\n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/gallery/Bank-UI-My-Accounts-Screens.png\" data-size=\"3840x2160\">\n        <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/gallery/Bank-UI-My-Accounts-Screens-thumbnail.png\" height=\"432\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>'My Accounts' Wireframe vs After</figcaption>\n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/gallery/Bank-UI-Current-Accounts-Screens.png\" data-size=\"3840x2160\">\n        <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/gallery/Bank-UI-Current-Accounts-Screens-thumbnail.png\" height=\"432\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>'Current Account' Wireframe vs FInal</figcaption>\n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/gallery/Bank-UI-My-Spending-Screens.png\" data-size=\"3840x2160\">\n        <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/7/gallery/Bank-UI-My-Spending-Screens-thumbnail.png\" height=\"432\" width=\"768\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      <figcaption>'My Spending' Wireframe vs FInal</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n    <h2 id=\"reflection\">\n      Reflection\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Although this app was not actually built and launched, the project gave me thorough, practical exposure to the importance of UI in software design\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I wasn’t completely new to the concept of designing screens prior to this project, due to my experience with graphic design and using Figma, but I learned that alone isn’t enough when it comes to good UI design.

It was also favourable that both fonts were open source and included multiple weights for flexibility. Initially, I paired both and intended to use Lexend has a headings font, and Zilla Slab as a body font, but as I continued to iterate my screen designs I settled on Lexend as the only font.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/Bank-UI-Fonts.png\" height=\"2160\" width=\"3840\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Fonts-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Fonts-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Fonts-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Fonts-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Fonts-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h2 id=\"step-4-create-a-colour-palette\">\n      Step 4: Create a Colour Palette\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    As with the fonts, I searched for playful and friendly colour inspiration. I looked at competitor apps but also explored palettes with blue and green shades in them – as the colour blue is associated with banking and the colour green is associated with money. I consequently created a palette of my own, made up of blue and green shades as accent colours, but also modified my selection slightly as I went through iterations.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette.png\" height=\"2160\" width=\"3840\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Bank-UI-Colour-Palette-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h2 id=\"step-5-generate-icons\">\n      Step 5: Generate Icons\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    For icon inspiration, I looked at some competitive apps but also searched for banking/finance specific icon sets.

True to <a href=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/fly-ux-2.html\" target=\"_blank\">my UX learnings</a>, I also kept the experience at the forefront of my mind for each design iteration.

Before jumping head-first into Figma, I created a list of screens and states based on the flow and sketched each of them out.

As the brief asked for medium-fidelity, I kept the aesthetics minimal, but added a good amount of layout, text, and interaction detail.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The result was different to what I had initially sketched, because my designs evolved as I continued to iterate, but the screens remained aligned with the user flow. An example of something I didn’t sketch was the search bar on the home screen. As I iterated, I thought why not give the user the ability to search for where they’d like to go as soon as the app opens?\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/Fly-UX-Prototyping.png\" height=\"2160\" width=\"3840\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Prototyping-xs.png 384w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Prototyping-sm.png 600w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Prototyping-md.png 768w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Prototyping-lg.png 1200w ,https://www.vikrantpelia.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Fly-UX-Prototyping-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h3 id=\"usability-test\">\n      Usability Test\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    I also asked family and friends to test the prototype and conducted a usability test.

            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    I visited my grandmother recently and mentioned that I was leaving my job to focus on pursuing a career in product design. I expected her to contest me leaving my comfortable, corporate job… but she didn’t. Instead, she asked me to explain what product design is. She heard me out and said… “you’ve always been interested in that — even as a child”.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Now, either my grandmother knows more about product design than I thought she did, or I just explained it very well. Either way, her response was spot on!<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I’ve been infatuated with the way things look and work since as far back as I can remember. I recall pulling things apart just to inspect why they looked and worked the way they did. I’d observe the way objects felt, the way they were shaped, their colours. I remember seeing an iMac G3 for the first time and thought it came from outer space!<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Granted, I wasn’t thinking too much into the details as a kid, but there was something about them that fascinated me. Looking back, those moments were foundations being laid for a future career in design.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    But then I grew up to study ‘Business’ at University, and pursue a career in marketing. I don’t know why, but that’s where destiny took me. Perhaps it’s because I was also quite entrepreneurial growing up. I knew I wanted to be in the world of business — and marketing seemed to be the most suitable home for my creative skills and right-brained nature.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I don’t regret my path, because I’ve learned a lot through working in marketing (especially graphic design) and got to work with amazing people on interesting projects. But in 2022, my interest in marketing started to fade. Marketing didn’t seem ‘for me’ anymore. I had switched from Brand Marketing to Product Marketing, and being closer to Product lit a flame in me… I wanted to get even closer. I started remembering those moments as a kid and felt an urge to follow my calling to become a Product Designer.<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    So, in September 2022, I decided to invest in myself by enrolling into UX and UI design courses. I ultimately want to be an Industrial Designer, but entering the software space felt like the most natural first step, because of my transferrable graphic design skills. I loved the courses, but there was an issue — with a demanding full-time job, I wasn’t able to give them all the attention they needed. I thought long and hard about what I should do, and felt a desire to resign from my job. In October, I decided to go all-in on product design and handed in my notice.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Long story short, I ended up staying on for three months in a part-time capacity. My boss kindly proposed it to me as it would give me the balance I needed to be able to study, as well as buy me some time to decide whether resigning is truly what I want. Three months later, it’s still what I want, and I’m writing this post as an unemployed student of product design.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    As one of my idols (Steve Jobs) once said… “You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards”. I feel like I’m finally following my calling. I’m doing what I was always supposed to do and I’ve never been more excited. I can’t wait to help make things that create a positive impact in the world. And maybe, just maybe, a kid somewhere will be fascinated enough to pull them apart and spark their own obsession with design.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I was always destined to be a designer, I just didn’t always know. But now I do.<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Thank you for reading,<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Vikrant\n  </p>",
